This website uses [<Logo name="umami" /> Umami Analytics](https://umami.is) to collect privacy-friendly analytics about your visit.

I'd like to have access to this information because:

- It shows me which blog articles have better engagement. (which ones you read and for how long you've been reading them).
- I'd like to know which websites are linking to mine [(referrer).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer)

I am a privacy-conscious guy, so I have taken measures to collect as little data about you as possible.

Even so, I understand if you'd like to opt-out of getting tracked.
