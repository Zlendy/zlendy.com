**Hello, world!**

At last, the blog is finally live. After working on previous iterations of this blog for some months now, albeit not as actively.

This is the first time I take writing seriously, so I have no idea how it will go, here be dragons.

My first real post will be an in-depth guide of how to install [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) using [btrfs](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io) and [snapper.](http://snapper.io) With more posts still cooking up in the oven üë®‚Äçüç≥

There are some features still missing from the blog, though. Some of them are:

- [x] View counter
- [x] Table of Contents
- [ ] Share button
- [ ] Tags
- [ ] Post search
- [x] RSS
